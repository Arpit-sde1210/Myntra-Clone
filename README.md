# Myntra Clone
This project is a front-end clone of Myntra, a popular Indian e-commerce website specializing in fashion and lifestyle products. The clone replicates key functionalities, including user authentication, product browsing, filtering, and a responsive shopping cart. The project showcases my proficiency in front-end development with modern frameworks, as well as my understanding of backend services and database management to create a seamless user experience.
